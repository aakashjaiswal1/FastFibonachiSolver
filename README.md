# FastFibonachiSolver
Returns the fibonacci sequence of a number in log(n) of the time.
This methord uses the matrix exponentiation methord.
Note to user:
I have taked internal modulo of 1e9+7 internally in every step to avoid overflow.
If user wants to disable working of internal modulo he/she can disable in the code.
